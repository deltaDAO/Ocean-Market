Using the built-in Compute-to-Data feature provided by Ocean Protocol, we are able to resolve the tradeoff between the benefits of using private data, and the risks of exposing it. The data is always under the control of it’s owner, never leaving it’s premise, yet 3rd parties are able to compute against it and can utilize computation results to train AI models for example."
