To learn about the code and connections between the components I've used the inspect+component tree in the browser. Also, I've tried to learn as much as possible 
about the Typescript, as I've never used it.
Later to figure out how to add the new page and connected it to the existing project I was using a global search in VSCode.
As long as creating a new component on the page by copying the Bookmark component, and finding a solution to add new info to the Table might have been easier,
refactoring the code to query the data from the Aquarius was tough and took me half of the whole "project time".

Thank You for this opportunity.
